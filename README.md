Udacity's Programming for Data Science Nanodegree program and their instructors were extremely helpful while I was pursuing this project.

# Overview:
* In this project _Python_ is used to explore data related to bikeshare systems for three major U.S. cities - Chicago, Washington, and New York City. 
* The source code takes in raw input from the user to create an interactive experience. 
* According to the input the code will import the data and will provide information by computing descriptive statistics.

# Files used:
* bikeshare.py
* the Data for all 3 cities that is used in this project can be accessed through the link mentioned below :

# Running the program:
* You can input_bikeshare.py_on your terminal to run this program, or use Anaconda's command .

# Requirements:
* Language: Python 3.6 or above.
* Libraries: pandas, numpy, time.

# Program Details:
The program takes user input for the city (e.g. Chicago), month for which the user wants to view data (e.g. January; also includes an 'all' option), and day for which the user wants to view data (e.g. Monday; also includes an 'all' option).

Upon receiving the user input, it goes ahead and asks the user if they want to view the raw data (5 rows of data initially) or not. Following the input received, the program prints the following details:

* Most popular month
* Most popular day
* Most popular hour
* Most popular start station
* Most popular end station
* Most popular combination of start and end stations
* Total trip duration
* Average trip duration
* Types of users by number
* Types of users by gender (if available)
* The oldest user (if available)
* The youngest user (if available)
* The most common birth year amongst users (if available)

Finally, the user is prompted with the choice of restarting the program or not.
